# Worklog

## 10.11.22
- Created Git repo and installed Sanity

## 11.11.22
- Created a Project on GitHub to try out. Don´t understand much.
- Added readme, log, and todo files.
- Tried to install Next, but got an error.
- Installed Sanity and Gatsby, but got a Babel-error.

## 12.11.22
- Got no Babel-errors on my laptop, so it´s probably something I need to install or update on the iMac.
- Got an error in Sanity tsconfig.json file. It found no .ts-files, so I added an empty one on root, and the error went away.
- Sendt the first draft for a data model to the Client.
- Created Github pages for the project [wyatt](https://michaelhelgesen.github.io/wyatt/) to be able to share progress and information with the client.
- Created Blogpost and Podcast schema in Sanity
