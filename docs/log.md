- Structured the content categories in Sanity Studio
- Added a dynamic meny in Gatsby.
- Studied how to **deploy to Netlify from Studio**.
- Watched a couple of videos and read some blogs about Sanity, and got a lot of ideas how to **structure the studio**. Adding modules to control the look of the page seems very cool - will need a design system though. **How can I import modules dynamically in Gatsby?**
## 13.11.22
- Added a menu schema for manualy handling of menu.
- Pages are working on the webpage.
