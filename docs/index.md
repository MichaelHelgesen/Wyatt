# A personal webpage for Laverne Wyatt
The client wants a webpage and a blog for her personal brand and podcast episodes.

## Tech
This project will be a combination of CMS, Static Site Generator, DAM and a hosting / deployment service.

### CMS
I want to use Sanity CMS for building the data model and managing the content. 
It´s flexible, and easy to use for both the developer and the content creator.

### Static Site Generator
**Gatsby was chosen, since I got a lot of errors trying to install Next, and I want to move on with the project.**

I´m not sure if I want to use Gatsby or Next in this project. I have experience with Gatsby, but would also want to learn Next.

I´ll read up on the pros and cons.

### DAM
The website will contain podcasts, images and illustrations.

I want to try to connect to Cloudinary, if they support sound files.

I also want to connect to Unsplash, for quick access to fresh photos.

### Deployment
Netlify will be the service of choice, as I have used it before, and it has great support with Gatsby and Next.
